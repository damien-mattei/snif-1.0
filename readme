COMPATIBILITY:
--------------


partially tested on the following systems,this means that at some point of development it was working on the system but test has not always been performed on the final release:

-Linux RedHat 5.2 (Apollo)
-Linux Redhat 7.2 (Enigma)
-Linux Redhat 7.3 (Valhalla)
-Linux Redhat 9.0 (Shrike)
-Linux Fedora Core 2
-Linux Fedora Core 2 64bits
-Linux Fedora Core 3
-Linux Fedora Core 5
-Linux Fedora Core 10
-Linux YLD 6.0, Yellow Dog Linux, PowerPC
-Linux Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish)

-Mac OS X.3 server (Panther),requires Xcode
-Mac OS X.3 (Panther),requires Xcode
-Mac OS X.4 (Tiger) Intel and PowerPC,requires Xcode v2.5
-Mac OS X.5 (Leopard)
-Mac OS X.13.6 (High Sierra)

-FreeBSD 5.3

partially supported on those systems:

-Mac OS X.2 (Jaguar) : works with -a option due to lack of hash table support in this version of Mac os X.
-Linux Fedora Core 6 : you will have to install the libpcap from sources before compiling


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------


an UNIX operating system with Packet Capture Library (libpcap) installed.

Libpcap is available from http://www.tcpdump.org/.



LINUX:

RPM versions of libpcap can be found at http://www.rpmfind.net and often are on contrib CDs of redhat or powertools sub-directories at ftp.redhat.com.

This program should compile and run on Linux RedHat version 5 to 9 and on Linux Fedora Core 1 to 6. 
Libpcap if not installed on your Linux RedHat system is available as RPM from ftp.redhat.com for Linux RedHat 5.2 and above.
Earlier versions of Linux needs to install libpcap from source.


MAC OS X (Darwin):

You need the developper tools in order to compile the program. The developper tools are available from Apple web site (http://www.apple.com) or from the CDs installation disks of Mac OS X.3,DVDs of Mac OS X.4 shipped with the iMac.
 

FreeBSD:

The compilation and running of this program has been successfully tested on FreeBSD 5.3. 



NETWORK:
--------

This program deals with a lot of link layer protocols (network layer 2) but due to lack of hardware access,only those media have been tested:
-ethernet
-wifi card (Airport card and broadcomm wireless card)
-PPP used with RTC modem
-loopback
-Linux cooked sockets (3G ICON 225 device)
-3G card ICON 225
-Apple USB Adapter

Some other link layer needs to be tested (ex: Token Ring), if you find any bug send me an email please.
